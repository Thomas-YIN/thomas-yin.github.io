## About me

I'm a MS Student in [Big Data Technology](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/academics/taught-postgraduate/msc-bdt) at
the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/). I received my Bachelor's degree with a double major in Data Science and Technology, and Computer Science from the same institution in 2023.

<small>I am typically open to supervising highly motivated and academically strong undergraduate students at HKUST who are interested in NLP. If you would like to collaborate with me, please feel free to send me an email with your CV and unofficial transcript. My email can be found at the left.</small>
