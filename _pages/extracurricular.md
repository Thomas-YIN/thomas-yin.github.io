I use this webpage to keep track of some non-academic experiences/achievements.

  Undergraduate) *(Sep. 2018 - Dec. 2018)*
- I was the **Student Teaching Helper** of [COMP1022P](http://course.cse.ust.hk/comp1022p)
  and [COMP2011](http://course.cse.ust.hk/comp2011), the main duty was grading students' lab works and answering their
  questions.
- I was the **School of Engineeringâ€™s Representative in Admission Interview** during *Jan. 2020, Jun. 2020, Jan. 2021,
  Jun. 2021, Jan. 2022, Jun. 2022*, where I shared my experience in HKUST and answered applicants' questions on

### Personal Hobbies

- I'm a huge fan of FPS games including CS:GO, Call of Duty, Battlefield, etc. I also love playing sport games such as NBA2K or FIFA. I ranked top 50 in CrossFire in 2018, and I'm now a global elite player in CS:GO.
