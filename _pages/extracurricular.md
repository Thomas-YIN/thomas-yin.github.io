This page is intended for my extracurricular activities, as well as my hobbies.

### Volunteer Experience

- I was one of the peer mentors in the Peer Mentor Program hosted by [**MSSSUG**](https://ug-msss.hkust.edu.hk/) (Mainland Scholar and Students Society Undergraduate), in which I led orientation activities for 1st-year undergraduate students to get adapted to university life, such as workshops on course registration, major selection, etc. <em style="float:right">*(Sep. 2020 - Jun. 2022)*</em>

### Sports Team
- I was on the HKUST [**MSSSUG**](https://ug-msss.hkust.edu.hk/) Basketball Team, in which I played the Small Forward (SF) position and wore uniform number 13. Shown below is a picture of our team after we won the game against HKU in the 2023 tournament. <em style="float:right">*(Sep. 2019 - Jun. 2023)*</em>
- I joined the HKUST [**MSSS**](https://msss.hkust.edu.hk/) Basketball Team after I began my postgraduate study, in which I played the Small Forward (SF) position and wore uniform number 5. <em style="float:right">*(Sep. 2023 - Jun. 2024)*</em>

### Personal Hobbies

- I am a huge coffee lover and I brew coffee every day. Most of the time I make espresso-based drinks, such as Latte and Americano, but I also make cold brew coffee and Vietnamese coffee from time to time.

- I am also an amateur photographer, interested in street photography and film photography. Check out my works on Instagram [@thomas_photo_booth](https://www.instagram.com/thomas_photo_booth/)!
