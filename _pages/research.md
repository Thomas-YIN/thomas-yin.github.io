During my undergraduate study, I have participated two UROP projects supervised by Professor Xiaojuan Ma and Professor Xiaofang Zhou. I have also worked with Professor Gary Chan, who is the supervisor for my final year project. My current research interests lie broadly in topics related to artificial intelligence, computer vision and machine learning.
