During my undergraduate study, I have participated two UROP projects supervised by [Professor Xiaojuan Ma](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~mxj/) and [Professor Xiaofang Zhou](https://sites.google.com/view/xiaofang-zhou) respectively, through which I have gradually discovered my passion for research. For the past year, I have also been fortunate to be advised by [Professor Gary Chan](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~gchan/) for my final year project on video analytics and occupancy detection in smart parking lots. My current research interests lie broadly in topics related to artificial intelligence, computer vision and machine learning.
