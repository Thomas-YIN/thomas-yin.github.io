During my undergraduate study, I have participated two UROP projects supervised by [Professor Xiaojuan Ma](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~mxj/) and [Professor Xiaofang Zhou](https://sites.google.com/view/xiaofang-zhou) respectively. I have also worked with [Professor Gary Chan](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~gchan/), who is the supervisor for my final year project. My current research interests lie broadly in topics related to artificial intelligence, computer vision and machine learning.
